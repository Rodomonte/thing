Premise: In the universe of Automania, an anomaly is occurring. Things are becoming self-aware. One Thing was discovered to make up all things conceivable.
         Even the thoughts in our minds. It was recently discovered how to capture these Things, but control them, not so much. This is the result.

Early Gameplay:
1. Become an Object or Concept via maintained proximity to Creator/Philosopher
2. Concept: Proliferating thought to gain Usage to buy more Concepts?
   Object: Interacting with other Objects to control them or improve oneself
3. Capture particles for Atomic Assembler
   - How?

Late Gameplay:
- Competitive: Race, Deathmatch/RTS, Objective (CTF/KOTH/etc), Combinations of those
- Progression:
  - Fastest time to unlock <Thing>
  - First to unlock <Thing> in Home Sector? Problem: One guy could create 100 sectors and claim most of it
- Global:
  - Universe expansion via Sector creation
  - Research initiatives (decide which update comes next)
- Society:
  - Concept-focused jobs:
    - Philosophers: Have Realizations using Induction/Deduction of Learned Concepts to Identify DAG neighbors
    - Scientists: Perform Experiments to Learn Identified Concepts
    - Researchers: Gather and supply data to all that use it
  - Object-focused jobs:
    - Engineers/Inventors: Create Machines/Devices
    - Mechanics/Technicians: Maintain Machines/Devices
    - Farmers: Gather Energy for Things

DAG:
- Each tier of Things costs less than the last (hard to become both Concept & Object)
- Each Concept costs Thought + trigger scenario to learn
- Each Thing has statuses (more can be added later like ownership under a society):
  Concepts: (Unidentified / Identified / Learned)
  Objects: Become, (Unidentified / Identified / Learned to Use / Learned to Create)

Pure Concept:
- All about control, no self

! Should Time depend on Object? Space on Concept? Everything could depend on Concept since everything could be simulated.
  Bad reasoning for Time to not depend on Object. Time and Space depend on both??
! Should Things have Observed/Learned status?
  Observed: Be made aware of this Thing in the DAG (after Observe?)
  Learned: Have access to abilities provided by Thing
! How to play as Object without vision? Can see no details/color?
! How to play as Wave without Concept? Wave depends on Concept?
! All Concepts rely on Being/Self.

! Lol make all synonyms randomly select in DAG, no one could talk about builds with each other

! How to play as Concept: Make AIs aware of thing to partially control them

! How to identify: Observe a Thing In Use. Automatic identification upon proximity.
  - Concept: Make them think.. Identify random or relevant Concepts?
    e.g. While mining, it could recognize
  - Attribute: Make them improve their own qualities
  - Action: Make them do things.
  - Relation: Make them interact? with another
  - Group: Make them join a / interact with their group

Claim: Everything can be represented in a dependency hierarchy.
Not just a tree, since things can have multiple parent REQs. Not just a graph, since dependencies would be too complicated. -> Directed acyclic graph

- For req, list no ancestors of any other req for that term.
- If 2 or more things work as reqs but only one OR another, the parent of those reqs is the parent of this term. Only when ALL reqs are required simultaneously
  for the same thing would you list both as reqs.
- If 2 things seem to depend on each other (Change/Time), ask, could one conceivably exist without the other? That's the parent.

- I need a process for designing this graph. Prioritization of tasks to speed it up. Currently going top down. Could...
  - Reasearch+list all Thing ideas, then add details or rule them out. This allows the DAG to fill naturally, no wasted time pondering potential relations
  - Research specific Things to find new Things close to it

! How to get from Particle to Solid Object? Need a way to gather other particles to assemble into atoms/molecules.
! Could playing a particle even be fun? What can you do? Simply combine yourself into something greater?
  - Particle - Object? - Can
    -> Graviton, Photon, Up/down quark?

! Solid Object -> ?
  - Operate a Bot (AIs are building these for Objects to operate)
  - Press buttons on machines to manufacture parts
  v Salvage parts from battles/junkyard
  v Have a player/AI teach creation/assembly methods
  ! How to move the parts to a location where they can be assembled? Can't communicate yet!
